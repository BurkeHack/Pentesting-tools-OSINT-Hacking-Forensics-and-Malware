•	Anonymous browsers: Browsers such as Tor, I2P, and Freenet use onion routing and cryptography to ensure user privacy and hide their IP address.
•	Use of proxies: Proxies act as intermediaries between the user and the server, which hides the user's IP address and allows you to browse anonymously, tor, Privoxy and Squid.
•	Data obfuscation: Data obfuscation can help prevent pattern detection and hide information. Data obfuscation tools, such as Obfsproxy and Shadowsocks, can help hide information and activities online.
